## Obtaining an integration token

If you dont have one already, you can folow the [Plaudit instructions on how to obtain it](https://plaudit.pub/integration):

*"To make sure Plaudit can handle the load, we are gradually rolling out integrations. Thus, at this point in time it is required to [contact us](mailto:integrate@plaudit.pub) if you are interested in integrating the Plaudit widget into your website. When your integration is approved, we will ask you for the host names you want to display the widget at (e.g. `example.com` and `dev.example.com`). You will then receive a token that can be used to integrate the widget at thost host names."*
